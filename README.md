## Recommended Tools

- Recommended Testnet: Sepolia (Or Tenderly Virtual Network)

# [Testnet Faucets](https://faucets.chain.link)

If you receive a flag pop-up requiring you to have 0.001 ETH on mainnet, you may be able to wait 10 to 20 minutes and try again to avoid adding the 0.001 ETH on the mainnet.

# Bonus NFTs

These are 100% optional to do.

- *Coming soon...*

After every section, in this GitHub repo will be a link to a contract on Sepolia or ZKsync. They contain a challenge for you to solve, and in return, you'll be given an AWESOME NFT.

## Important Notes for ZKsync

IF YOU DECIDE TO MINT THE REAL NFT:

1. We didn't audit the NFT, so if you want to make sure you'll be safe, interact with the contract using a burner wallet (a wallet with very little money that you don't use for anything else)
   1. In fact... Get good at interacting with wallets from a burner wallet
2. Read my [Tweet thread on basic wallet safety](https://twitter.com/PatrickAlphaC/status/1663936101650685954)
3. It might be a good idea to wait till later in the course when we teach you about verifying metamask transactions.
4. Feel free to mint NFTs on sepolia without worrying about the above -->

## Bridging to ZKsync

If you want to work with *real* funds on ZKsync for any challenges that we deploy there, you can follow this list. 

*Please do not use real funds unless you are confident of what you are doing, especially when it comes to private key safety.*

1. The process for bridging looks like the following:
   1. Buy ETH (On an exchange like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/home) or [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/))
2. Send ETH -> one of your wallets like:
   1. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)
   2. [Frame](https://frame.sh/)
   3. [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/)
   4. [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz/)
   5. [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)
3. Use the [ZKsync Bridge](https://portal.zksync.io/bridge/)

# Welcome to the Course Repo

## Best Practices

- **Follow the repository:** While going through the course be 100% certain to follow along with the github repository. If you run into an issue check the chronological-updates in the repo.
- **Be Active in the community:** Ask questions and engage with other developers going through the course in the discussions tab, be sure to go and say hello or gm! This space is different from the other industries, you don't have to be secretive; communicate, network and learn with others :)
- **Learn at your own pace:** It doesn't matter if it takes you a day, a week, a month or even a year. Progress >>> Perfection
- **Take Breaks:** You will exhaust your mind and recall less if you go all out and watch the entire course in one sitting.
  **Suggested Strategy** every 25 minutes take a 5 min break, and every 2 hours take a longer 30 min break
- **Refer to Documentation:** Things are constantly being updated, so whenever Patrick opens up some documentation, open it on your end and maybe even have the code sample next to you.
- **Use ChatGPT and/or the course chat**

# Section 0: Welcome to the Course!

- [Welcome to Web3!](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/blockchain-basics)

----------------------

# Section 1: Blockchain Basics

> [!IMPORTANT] Please be sure to go through blockchain basics before coming here! The GitHub repository for that curriculum can be found here:

# Vyper 101
----------------------
## Section 1: Welcome to Remix - Favorite's List

üíª Code: [https://github.com/Cyfrin/remix-favorites-cu](https://github.com/Cyfrin/remix-favorites-cu)

- [Bits & Bytes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dnd28lQHquU)
- [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/?mtm_campaign=partner&mtm_kwd=cyfrin)

### üê∏üê¶ [Tweet Me (add your contract in)!](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%20just%20deployed%20a%20Smart%20Contract%20using%20%40vyperlang!%0a%0a%20Thanks%20%40PatrickAlphaC%2C%20%40zksyncdevs%2C%20and%20%40cyfrinupdraft!)

### Workshop

Spend at most 25 minutes on all of these prompts without the aide of AI. If you're unable to solve them after 25 minutes, stop, take a break, and then work with an AI or the discussions to help you solve them. Good luck!

1. Create a function called `add` that adds `1` to whatever is in `self.favorite_number`
2. Have the starting favorite number different from `7`, check to make sure it's the number you set!
3. (Challenging) Create a new type using the "struct" keyword, and create a function that will save a new variable of that type to a state/storage variable.

## Section 2: Remix Buy Me A Coffee

üíª Code: [https://github.com/Cyfrin/remix-buy-me-a-coffee-cu](https://github.com/Cyfrin/remix-buy-me-a-coffee-cu)

- [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/?mtm_campaign=partner&mtm_kwd=cyfrin)

### Workshop

Spend at most 25 minutes on all of these prompts without the aide of AI. If you're unable to solve them after 25 minutes, stop, take a break, and then work with an AI or the discussions to help you solve them. Good luck!

1. (Optional) Get the price of a different asset using Chainlink price feeds on your fake chain
2. Write a function to get the total amount of funds in the contract
   1. Loop through the array of funders, and how much they've funded!
   2. Try not to just use `self.balance`!
3. (Challenging!) Write a function that allows you to change the owner of the contract
   1. Hint: You'll need to make sure `OWNER` isn't immutable!
  
<p align="right">(<a href="#table-of-contents">back to top</a>) ‚¨ÜÔ∏è</p>

## Section 3: AI Prompting, Asking Questions, and Researching
-----------------------

No code here!

### Workshop

Get a good idea for "how good" your AI is. Maybe shop around for an AI you like. Ask them some softball questions to figure out how smart they are. Like:

1. Make a minimal vyper contract
2. What's the difference between a dynamic array and a fixed sized array?
3. Here is some vyper code:

```python
@external
def add_person(name: String[100], favorite_number: uint256):
    new_person: Person = Person(favorite_number = favorite_number, name = name)
    self.list_of_people[self.list_of_people_index] = new_person
    self.list_of_numbers[self.list_of_people_index] = favorite_number
    self.list_of_people_index += 1
    self.name_to_favorite_number[name] = favorite_number
```
What does it do? 

4. Is this vyper code safe?
```python
send(OWNER, self.balance)
```

# Moccasin Fundamentals 
-----------------------
## Section 1: Python Crash Course

Python Version: 3.11

Full code: [https://github.com/Cyfrin/python-in-updraft-cu](https://github.com/Cyfrin/python-in-updraft-cu)

### Google Collab

- [Completed Code: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QHoHoTmJjMXKwnbD-00okxP3supNCvvF?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QHoHoTmJjMXKwnbD-00okxP3supNCvvF?usp=sharing)

### Installation & Setup (MacOS & Linux)

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - [Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPqXP_kLzpo)
- [VSCode Keybindings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [What is a terminal?](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal)

### Installation & Setup (Windows/WSL)

- Special Guest [Vasiliy](https://twitter.com/cromewar)
- [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
  - When working in WSL, use Linux commands instead of Windows commands
- [TroubleShooting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/troubleshooting)
- `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please use Gitpod as an absolute last resort

### Gitpod or CodeSpaces

- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
  - **If using this, NEVER share a private key with real money on Gitpod**
  - Ideally you figure out the MacOS, Linux, or Windows install though

### Install Python (Windows WSL/Linux/Ubuntu)

To check for python, run:

```bash
which python
python --version

which python3
python3 --version
```

To install a specific version of python:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.11
```

## Local Development Introduction

- `CMD + K` or `CTRL + K` clears the terminal
- `code .` to open VSCode in a new VSCode window

### Workshop

Spend at most 25 minutes on all of these prompts without the aide of AI. If you're unable to solve them after 25 minutes, stop, take a break, and then work with an AI or the discussions to help you solve them. Good luck!

Here is your final project, make a function that takes 2 inputs, the first is a year, and the second is a number of days.
The function should print out either:

```bash
Y days after Jan 1st, X, it will still be the year X
```
or
```bash
Y days after Jan 1st, X, it will be the year Z
```
Where:
- `X` is the starting year, the first input  to the function
- `Y` is the number of days, the second input to the function
- `Z` is the year after the X number of days

*Examples*

The function invocations will look like this:
```python
what_year(1985, 376)
```
Which should print:
```bash
376 days after Jan 1st, 1985, it will be the year 1986
```

Or
```python
what_year(1985, 200)
```
Which should print:
```bash
200 days after Jan 1st, 1985, it will still be the year 1985
```

Or
```python
what_year(1985, 1098)
```
Which should print:
```bash
1098 days after Jan 1st, 1985, it will be the year 1988
```

Notice how "still" is added to the second sentance, but not the first!

*Assumptions*
1. Assume a year is 365 days (but, if you're off by a day or two, that's ok)
2. Don't worry about leap years
3. Don't use the datetime package!

   1. You should always be learning more by doing more!

### Workshop

Spend at most 1 week on this :) 

Feel free to use some AI!

#### Prompt

Build a smart contract lottery/raffle yourself, using minimal AI help. You can build a "weak randomness" lotttery, using on-chain randomness (but just know, it's not secure!). Or go the extra mile and use Chainlink VRF 2.5 to build a secure lottery.

You should:
1. Have test coverage of over 80% of your lines of code
2. Have a function called `enter_raffle` for people to enter your raffle
3. The raffle should pick 1 winner after X seconds 
   1. Have this be a customizable variable
4. The winner should get the sum of all the entrance fees added by the other participants
5. Anyone can call a `pick_winner` or `request_winner` function, that will randomly select the winner. 

Here are some example code bases to help you:

- üíª Weak Randomness Code: [https://github.com/Cyfrin/mox-raffle-cu](https://github.com/Cyfrin/mox-raffle-cu)

- üíª Chainlink VRF 2 (Not 2.5 - this code is slightly outdated) Code: [https://github.com/Cyfrin/mox-raffle-cu/tree/e41e3216137ff86c1f663a6730c52dd38586ec12](https://github.com/Cyfrin/mox-raffle-cu/tree/e41e3216137ff86c1f663a6730c52dd38586ec12)
